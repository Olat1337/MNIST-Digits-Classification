# MNIST Digits Classification

Built a fully connected neural network model to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. This project demonstrates a simple approach to recognize digits from grayscale images and evaluate model performance, including visualization of predictions and errors.

## General Info

The MNIST dataset contains images of handwritten digits (0â€“9) widely used for training and testing image classification models. This project loads and preprocesses the data, trains a neural network with two hidden layers and dropout, and analyzes the results with a confusion matrix and error visualization.

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- Keras  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- scikit-learn  

## Conclusions

- The model successfully learns to classify handwritten digits.  
- Visualization helps understand common misclassifications.  
- Dropout helps reduce overfitting.  
- The approach can be a baseline before trying more complex models like CNNs.
